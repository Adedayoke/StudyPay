## 🎯 **The Problem**

**Nigerian families waste $2.8 billion annually on payment delays and fees:**

- 💸 **$25-45 fees** per transfer (vs $0.50 with StudyPay)

- 📱 **No mobile payment app** designed for campus life
- 🏪 **Vendors lose sales** due to payment complexity
- 🌐 **No offline access** during network outages

*Over 500,000 Nigerian university students and 2 million diaspora parents affected*
