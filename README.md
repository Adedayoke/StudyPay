## The Problem

Nigerian parents working abroad currently face significant challenges sending money to their children at university:
- Western Union/MoneyGram fees: $15-45 per transfer
- Transfer time: 3-7 business days
- Students wait for funds while missing meals or unable to pay for transport
- Parents have no visibility into how money is spent on campus

This affects Nigerian diaspora families sending an estimated $21+ billion in remittances annually.

## The Solution

StudyPay leverages Solana Pay to enable:
- **30-second transfers** from parent wallets to student campus accounts
- **Sub-dollar fees** instead of $15-45 traditional remittance costs
- **Campus spending integration** via QR code payments at vendors
- **Real-time transparency** for parents to track spending

## Live Demo

**Try the full system:** [studypay-sable.vercel.app](https://studypay-sable.vercel.app)

- **Student Dashboard**: Receive funds, pay campus vendors
- **Parent Portal**: Send money, monitor spending
- **Vendor Interface**: Accept payments via QR codes

## Key Features

### Real Solana Pay Integration
- Official Solana Pay protocol implementation
- QR code generation for payment requests
- Transaction confirmation with blockchain verification
- Multi-wallet support (Phantom, Solflare)

### Campus-Focused Utility
- Student-to-vendor payments for food, transport, services
- Parent-to-student international transfers
- Transaction categorization and spending tracking
- Emergency fund allocation and controls

### Progressive Web App

- Push notifications for payments and alerts
- Installable like native mobile apps

## How It Works

### For Students
1. Receive instant transfers from parents abroad
2. Pay campus vendors by scanning QR codes
3. Track spending by category (food, transport, books)
4. Request emergency funds when needed

### For Parents
1. Send money instantly via Solana Pay (vs days with traditional services)
2. Monitor real-time spending with transaction notifications
3. Set spending limits and emergency fund controls
4. Pay significantly lower fees (under $1 vs $15-45)

### For Campus Vendors
1. Generate QR codes for specific payment amounts
2. Receive instant settlement confirmation
3. Avoid cash handling and change-making issues
4. Track daily sales with digital receipts
